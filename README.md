# Class Attributes and Methods Lab

## Learning Goals

- Use class attributes and methods to write durable and powerful code.
  - Store and access song data using class attributes and methods.
- Accomplish complex programming tasks using knowledge from previous modules.

---

## Key Vocab

- **Attribute**: variables that belong to an object.
- **Constant**: variable whose value cannot be changed.
- **Instance**: one specific working copy of a class. It is created when a
  class's `__init__` method is called.
- **Class**: a bundle of data and functionality. Can be copied and modified to
  accomplish a wide variety of programming tasks.
- **Static**: an attribute or method that cannot manipulate the class or
  instance it belongs to.
- **Exception**: an error that occurs during the execution of a program.
  Exceptions can be anticipated and handled without disrupting the execution of
  the program.

## Introduction

<!-- In this lab, we'll be dealing with a `Song` class. The `Song` class can produce
individual songs. Each song has a name, an artist and a genre. We need our -->

`Song` class to be able to keep track of the number of songs that it creates.

```py
Song.count
# => 30
```

We need our `Song` class to be able to show us all of the artists of existing
songs:

```py
Song.artists
# ["Jay-Z", "Drake", "Beyonce"]
```

We need our `Song` class to be able to show us all of the genres of existing
songs:

```py
Song.genres
# => ["Rap", "Pop"]
```

We also need our `Song` class to be able to keep track of the number of songs of
each genre it creates.

In other words, calling:

```py
Song.genre_count
```

Should return something like this;

```py
{"Rap": 5, "Rock": 1, "Country": 3}
```

Lastly, we want our `Song` class to reveal to us the number of songs each artist
is responsible for.

```py
Song.artist_count
# {"Beyonce": 17, "Jay-Z": 40}
```

We'll accomplish this with the use of **class attributes** and **class
methods**.

## Instructions

Define your `Song` class such that an individual song is initialized with a
name, artist and genre.

```py
ninety_nine_problems = Song("99 Problems", "Jay-Z", "Rap")

ninety_nine_problems.name
# "99 Problems"

ninety_nine_problems.artist
# "Jay-Z"

ninety_nine_problems.genre
# "Rap"
```

<!-- Create a class attribute, `count`. We will use this attribute to keep track of
the number of new songs that are created from the `Song` class. Set this
attribute equal to `0`. -->
<!--
At what point should we increment our `count` of songs? Whenever a new song is
created. Your `__init__` method should call a class method
`add_song_to_count()` that increments the value of `count` by one. -->

Next, define the following class methods:

`add_to_genres()`: adds any new genres to a class attribute `genres`, a
list. This list should contain only _unique genres_ â€” no duplicates! Think
about what you'll need to do to get this method working:

<!-- - You'll need a class attribute, let's call it `genres`, that is equal to an
  empty list. -->
<!-- - When should you add genres to the array? Whenever a new song is created.
  Your `__init__` method should add the genre of the song being created to
  the `genres` list. All genres should be added to the list. Control for
  duplicates when you code your `add_to_genres` class method, not when you add
  genres to the original `genres` list. We will want to know how many songs
  of each genre have been created. We'll revisit that job a little later on. -->

<!-- `add_to_artists()`: adds any new artists to a class attribute `artists`, a
list. This list should only contain unique artists, just like the `genres`
class attribute. Once again, thnk about what you need to do to implement this
behavior: -->

<!-- - You'll need a class attribute, `artists`, that is equal to an empty list. -->
<!-- - When should you add artists to this array? Whenever a new song is
  initialized. Your `__init__` method should add artists to the `artists` -->
  list. All artists should be added to the list. Control for duplicates when
  you code your `add_to_artists()` class method, not when you add artists to
  the original `artists` list. We will want to know how many songs each have
  been assigned to each artist. We'll revisit that job a little later on when
  we write our `add_to_artist_count()` method.

`add_to_genre_count()`: adds to a class attribute `genre_count`, a dictionary
in which the keys are the names of each genre. Each genre name key should point
to a value that is the number of songs that have that genre.

```py
Song.genre_count
# {"Rap": 5, "Rock": 1, "Country": 3}
```

This manner of displaying numerical data is called a
[histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram). How will you create your
histogram? There are a few ways!

- You can need to iterate over the `genres` list and populate a dictionary with
  the key/value pairs. You will need to check to see if the hash already
  contains a key of a particular genre. If so, increment the value of that key
  by one, otherwise, create a new key/value pair.

`add_to_artist_count()`: creates a histogram similar to the one above, but for
artists rather than genres.
